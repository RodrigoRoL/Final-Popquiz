# Final-Popquiz


## Description

The aim of this challenge was to create a quiz app, that will test whoever plays it in their Javascript knowledge. It can be used for users to test fellow classmates, test their skills acquired and in general for everyone that wants to have fun! Through this coding process I learne more about API, specially trying to set a clock timer and console storage.
